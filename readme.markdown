This is a Scratchpad where I try something that I call CommandBasedComponents (which is an analogy to EventBasedComponents). A huge part of that project is a brain dump from what [Bj√∂rn Rochen](http://bjro.de/) showed to us on .NET OpenSpace 2011, which was how he interpreted EventBasedComponents for his last project.

If you has some questions or ideas how to improve that, please drop me a line.
